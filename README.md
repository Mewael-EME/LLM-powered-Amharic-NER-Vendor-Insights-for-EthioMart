# Insurance Risk Analytics - Week 03

This project performs structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an insurance dataset as part of the KAIM weekly challenge. The EDA is modularized into reusable scripts and visualized interactively in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📌 EDA Tasks Overview

### ✅ 1. Data Overview
- Loaded and previewed the dataset.
- Computed summary statistics for numerical columns like:
  - `TotalPremium`, `TotalClaim`, etc.
- Verified data types to ensure proper classification of numerical, categorical, and date fields.

### ✅ 2. Data Quality Check
- Detected and quantified missing values across features.
- Generated a summary table with both counts and percentages of missing entries.

### ✅ 3. Univariate Analysis
- Visualized distributions of:
  - Numeric columns using histograms
  - Categorical columns using bar charts
- Plots are saved in the `task4/plots/` directory.

### ✅ 4. Bivariate & Multivariate Exploration
- Analyzed variable relationships:
  - Correlation matrix for numerical columns
  - Scatter plots of `TotalPremium` vs `TotalClaim`, colored by `ZipCode`
- Aimed to uncover associations and regional trends.

### ✅ 5. Comparative Analysis
- Compared key attributes by geography:
  - Box plots of `TotalPremium` by `CoverType` and `ZipCode`
  - Frequency distribution of `AutoMake` by region

### ✅ 6. Outlier Detection
- Identified potential outliers using box plots:
  - Focused on features such as `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaim`

### ✅ 7. Key Visual Insights
Three custom plots were created to highlight important findings:
1. **Premium-Claim Ratio** – Distribution showing relative risk levels
2. **Top AutoMakes by Region** – Popular car makes across different zip codes
3. **Monthly Premium Patterns** – Time-based trends in total premiums (if temporal data exists)

# EthioMart E-commerce LLM - Task 1: Data Ingestion & Preprocessing

This project collects and cleans Telegram messages from Ethiopian e-commerce channels in Amharic language.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in your Telegram API credentials.

3. Run the ingestion pipeline:


python main.py

## Folder Structure

- `src/` - Core scripts (Telegram client, data cleaning)
- `data/` - Raw and processed message data
- `images/` - Downloaded media files
- `notebooks/` - Exploration and testing notebooks
- `tests/` - Unit tests for core modules

## Next Steps

- Task 2: Label data for NER
- Task 3: Fine-tune NER model
