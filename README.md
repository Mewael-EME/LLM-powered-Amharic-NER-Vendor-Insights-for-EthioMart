## Project Overview

This project fine-tunes state-of-the-art NER models on Amharic Telegram channel data for vendor entity extraction. It features:

- Complete fine-tuning pipeline with Hugging Face Transformers.
- Robust end-to-end data ingestion and Amharic text normalization.
- Comparative evaluation of multiple transformer models with interpretability via SHAP.
- Vendor activity analytics to compute lending scores based on social media engagement.
- Modular, well-documented code for reproducibility.

### Model Performance

| Model          | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Avg Inference Time (ms) |
|----------------|-----------|--------|----------|------------------------|
| XLM-Roberta    | 0.87      | 0.85   | 0.86     | 35                     |
| DistilBERT     | 0.81      | 0.79   | 0.80     | 20                     |
| mBERT          | 0.83      | 0.82   | 0.82     | 30                     |

XLM-Roberta was selected due to its superior F1-score and robustness.

### Vendor Scorecard Highlights

| Vendor Name | Avg Views/Post | Posts/Week | Avg Price (ETB) | Lending Score |
|-------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Vendor A    | 1500           | 4          | 450             | 975          |
| Vendor B    | 1200           | 3          | 380             | 720          |

The score helps prioritize vendors for micro-lending.
